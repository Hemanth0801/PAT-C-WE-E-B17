#for loop and while loop arte two loops which are there in python

#for i in range(1,10):   #rnage works in int data type with start, stop
 #   print(i)
#for x in range(10):
#    print(x)
#for b in range(0,10,2):   #rnage works in int data type with start, stop, step
 #   print(b)
#rev erse order
# for i in range(10,0,-1):
#   print(i)

#a=("123")
#for i in a:
 #   print(i)
  #  print(type(i))

#list1=["hello",'hi',1]
#for i in list1:
#   print(i)

#while check for a condition to be true to excute while blocks
#a=0
#while a<5:
#    print(a)
 #   a +=1

 #nested loop -> loop inside loop  -> more than one loop is also called nested loop
#it could be for loop inside for loop
#or while loop inside while  loop

for i in range (1,10):
    while i<5:
